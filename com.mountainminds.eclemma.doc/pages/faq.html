<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3><a name="usage01"></a>How can I remove the coverage coloring from the Java editors again?</h3>
<p>
  If you remove the coverage session, also the coverage coloring will disappear.
  For this, hit <i>Remove Session</i> or <i>Remove All Sessions</i> in the
  <i>Coverage</i> view's toolbar.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage03"></a>How can I run {whateverapplication} with EclEmma?</h3>
<p>
  EclEmma is designed for Java programs launched within Eclipse. Java
  applications that run in a different environment may be directly analyzed with
  <a class="extern" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco">JaCoCo</a> using for
  example the Ant or Maven integrations. There are different supported launch
  types, other plug-ins may define additional launch types which are not
  supported by EclEmma. Check user  documentation for currently supported launch types.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage04"></a>Does EclEmma support automated Ant or Maven builds?</h3>
<p>
  EclEmma is a Eclipse integration of the
  <a class="extern" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco">JaCoCo</a> code
  coverage tool. JaCoCo comes with a set of
  <a class="extern" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/ant.html">Ant tasks</a>
  and <a class="extern" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html">Maven goals</a>
  for automated builds. 
</p>

<h3><a name="usage05"></a>How do I change the source code highlighting?</h3>
<p>
  The source code highlighting can be changed in the Eclipse <i>Preference</i>
  dialog at <i>General &rarr; Appearance &rarr; Editors &rarr; Text Editors
  &rarr; Annotations</i>. You can modify the highlighting style and color or use
  the vertical rulers instead.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage07"></a>Do I need source code to use EclEmma?</h3>
<p>
  No, you can also get coverage information for e.g. third-party JARs. Just
  make them part of your class path settings in Eclipse and select them on the
  <i>Coverage</i> tab in the coverage launch dialog. If the library was compiled
  with debug information, line coverage will be shown in the
  <i>Coverage</i> view. In case the source is properly attached to the library
  syntax highlighting will happen in the editors the same way as with you source
  code.
</p> 

<h3><a name="usage08"></a>Why is this line yellow?</h3>
<p>
  EclEmma annotates all lines which are partly covered in yellow. Partly covered
  means that not all instructions and branches associated with this line have
  been executed during the coverage session. In some cases it is not obvious why
  the Java compiler creates extra byte code for a particular line of source code.
  Such <a class="extern" href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/eclemma/wiki/FilteringOptions">situations</a>
  might be filtered by future versions of JaCoCo/EclEmma. 
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3><a name="trouble01"></a>I get the error message "No coverage data file has been written". Please help!</h3>
<p>
  This may have several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No instrumented class has been loaded during the test run at all. Make
  sure that the classes in focus are selected for instrumentation in the
  coverage launch dialog.</li>
  <li>The Java process did not terminate properly, e.g. has been manually killed
  with the <i>Terminate</i> button. Make sure your program terminates on its
  own.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="trouble02"></a>Code with exceptions shows no coverage. Why?</h3>
<p>
  The underlying JaCoCo code coverage library works with so called <i>probes</i>.
  Probes are inserted into the control flow at certain positions. Code is
  considered as executed when a subsequent probe has been executed. In case of
  exceptions such a sequence of instructions is aborted somewhere in the middle
  and not marked as executed.
</p>

<h3><a name="trouble03"></a>My application does not run with EclEmma!</h3>
<p>
  Does your application properly execute within Eclipse in normal <i>run</i>
  mode? Please verify! If not, your app will most likely not execute in
  <i>coverage</i> mode either. In this case first create a proper launch
  configuration in Eclipse; then execute in <i>coverage</i> mode.
</p>

<h3><a name="trouble04">My Eclipse workbench window has no toolbar button for coverage launches!</a></h3>
<p>
  Even if EclEmma is installed properly, it will show its action sets only in
  some predefined perspectives related to Java tasks. If you want to use the
  coverage toolbar in other perspectives like <i>Resource</i> select
  <i>Customize Perspective...</i> from the toolbar's context menu and check the
  <i>Coverage</i> option on the <i>Commands</i> tab.
</p>

<h3><a name="trouble05">Why are JUnit4 test cases with expected exceptions shown as not covered?</a></h3>
<p>
  JUnit4 test cases with expected exceptions are shown as not covered even
  though they were executed. The reason for this is that underlying JaCoCo code
  coverage library only considers code as executed when certain probes are
  executed. For successful test cases marked with <code>@Test{expected=...}</code>
  this is not the case. See also <a href="#trouble02">"Code with exceptions
  shows no coverage. Why?"</a>.
