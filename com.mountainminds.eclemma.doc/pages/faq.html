<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3><a name="usage01"></a>How can I remove the coverage coloring from the Java editors again?</h3>
<p>
  If you remove the coverage session, also the coverage coloring will disappear.
  For this, hit <i>Remove Session</i> or <i>Remove All Sessions</i> in the
  <i>Coverage</i> view's toolbar.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage02"></a>Why can't I select source folders separately for instrumentation?</h3>
<p>
  EMMA works on Java class files. If source folders have the same output
  location, only all or none of them can be selected for instrumentation. If you
  want to select them individually please specify a different output location
  for each source folder. This can be done in the <i>Java Build Path</i>
  settings in the project properties. Check <i>Allow output folders</i> on the
  <i>Source</i> tab and specify different output folders for your source folders
  (for example bin-src/, bin-test/ etc.).
</p>

<h3><a name="usage03"></a>How can I run {whateverapplication} with EclEmma?</h3>
<p>
  EclEmma is designed for Java programs launched within Eclipse. Java
  Applications that run in a different environment may be analyzed with the
  <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA library</a> directly. There are
  different supported launch types, other plug-ins may define additional launch
  types which are not supported by EclEmma. Check user documentation for
  currently supported launch types.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage04"></a>Does EclEmma support automated Ant builds?</h3>
<p>
  EclEmma is a Eclipse integration of the EMMA code coverage tool. EMMA itself
  comes with a comprehensive set of Ant tasks and can be used in automated
  builds. See <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/docs.html">EMMA documentation</a>
  for details.
</p>


<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3><a name="trouble01"></a>I get the error message "No coverage data file has been written". Please help!</h3>
<p>
  This may have several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No instrumented class has been loaded during the test run at all. Make
  sure that the classes in focus are selected for instrumentation in the
  coverage launch dialog.</li>
  <li>The Java process did not terminate properly, e.g. has been manually killed
  with the <i>Terminate</i> button. Make sure your program terminates on its
  own.</li>
  <li>Your project contains the emma.jar file file in its Java path or contains
  a emma.properties file. To make EclEmma work properly, your project must not
  contain any EMMA specific resources or settings.</li>
  <li>Your launch configuration defines EMMA specific system properties. Make
  sure no such definitions are made.</li>
  <li>There is a emma.jar file in your JDK's lib/ext/ folder. Please remove this
  and restart Eclipse.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="trouble02">Does EclEmma work with IBM Rational 6.0 products?</a></h3>
<p>
  No, these products are based on Eclipse 3.0, EclEmma requires at least Eclipse
  3.1. IBM Rational 7.0 products are based on Eclipse 3.2 and may work with
  EclEmma.
