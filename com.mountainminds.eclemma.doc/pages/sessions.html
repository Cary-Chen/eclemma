<h2>Managing Coverage Sessions</h2>

<p>
  A <i>coverage session</i> is the code coverage information of particular
  program run. It contains the list of considered Java classes along with the
  recorded coverage details.
</p>

<h3>Session Lifecycle</h3>

<p>
  A coverage session is automatically created for each
  <a href="launching.html">coverage launch</a>. Alternatively sessions can be
  imported from external launches. The <a href="coverageview.html">coverage
  view</a> allows removing the sessions again.
</p>
 
<p>
  All coverage sessions are deleted when the workbench is closed.
</p>

<h3>The Active Session</h3>

<p>
  Even if there can be multiple coverage sessions, only one session can be the
  <i>active</i> coverage session. The active session can be selected from a
  drop-down list in the <a href="coverageview.html">coverage view</a> and defines
  the input of this view as well as the Java editor highlighting.
</p>

<h3>Merging Sessions</h3>

<p>
  If the overall test set consists of multiple test launches, they will result in
  multiple different coverage session. For analysis it may make sense to combine
  these sessions to a single session. If there is more than one session the
  <a href="coverageview.html">coverage view</a> provides the <i>Merge Sessions</i>
  command. This command allows selecting a subset from the existing sessions
  and combining to a single session.
