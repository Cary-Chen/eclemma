<p>
  The coverage view automatically appears when a new coverage session is added
  or can manually be opened from the <em>Window &rarr; Show View</em> menu in
  the <em>Java</em> category. It shows all instrumented Java elements within the
  common Java hierarchy. For each element the total number of items and the
  number of items covered within the active session is shown, always including
  the child elements of the respective Java element. The view allows to switch
  between the number of bytecode instructions, basic blocks and lines.
</p>

<p>
  The elements may be re-ordered by clicking the respective column header.
  Double-clicking an element opens its declaration in an editor.
