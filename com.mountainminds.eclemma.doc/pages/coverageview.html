<h2>Using the Coverage View</h2>

<p>
  The <i>Coverage</i> view automatically appears when a new coverage session is
  added or can manually opened from the <em>Window &rarr; Show View</em> menu
  in the <em>Java</em> category. It shows coverage summaries for the active
  session.
</p>

<p>  
  The <i>Coverage</i> view shows all instrumented Java elements within the
  common Java hierarchy. For each element the total number of items and the
  number of items covered within the active session is shown, always including
  the child elements of the respective Java element. You can select between the
  number of bytecode instructions, basic blocks or lines.
</p>

<p>
  The elements may be re-ordered by clicking the respective column header.
  Double-clicking an element opens its declaration in an editor with
  <a href="annotations.html">highlighted</a> source code.

  session.</li>
  <li><b>Remove Active Session</b>: Remove the currently selected coverage
  session.</li>
  <li><b>Remove All Sessions</b>: Remove all coverage sessions.</li>
  <li><b>Merge Sessions</b>: Merges multiple sessions into a single one.</li>
  <li><b>Select Session</b>: Select session from the drop down-menu and make
  it the active session.</li>
  <li><b>Show Elements</b>: Select Java elements shown as root entries
  in the coverage tree: Projects, package fragment roots (source folders or
  libraries), package fragments or types.</li>
  <li><b>Counter Mode</b>: Different counter modes can be selected from the
  view's drop-down menu: bytecode instructions, basic blocks and lines.</li>  
</ul>

<p>
  Some of the actions are deactivated if there is no session or only a single
  session.
