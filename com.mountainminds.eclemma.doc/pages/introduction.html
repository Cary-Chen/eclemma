<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  EclEmma is a free Java code coverage tool for Eclipse, available under the 
  <a href="license.html">Eclipse Public License</a>. Internally it is based on
  the great <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a> Java code coverage
  tool, trying to adopt EMMA's philosophy for the Eclipse workbench:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Fast develop/test cycle:</b> Launches from within the workbench like
    JUnit test runs can directly be analyzed for code coverage. There is no
    need to configure your projects or perform any other setup.</li>
  <li><b>Rich coverage analysis:</b> Coverage results are immediately summarized
    and highlighted in the Java source code editors.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The Eclipse integration has its focus on supporting the individual developer
  in an highly interactive way. Please refer to Emma's command line tools and
  Ant tasks for automated test runs and report generation for teams.

<p>
  Currently the following launch types are supported:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Local java application</b></li>
  <li><b>JUnit test run</b></li>
</ul>


<h3>Analysis</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Source highlighting:</b> The result of a coverage session is directly
  visible in the Java-Editor. A customizable color code highlights fully,
  partly and not covered lines. This works for your own source code as well as 
  for source attached to instrumented external libraries.</li>
  
  <li><b>Coverage overview:</b> A specialized view lists coverage summaries
  for your projects, packages, classes and methods.</li>

  <li><b>Multiple coverage sessions:</b> Switching between coverage data from
  multiple sessions is possible.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Import/Export</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Coverage data import:</b> A wizard allows to import <code>*.ec</code>
  coverage data files from external launches.</li>
  <li><b>Coverage report export:</b> Coverage data can be exported in XML or
  HTML format.</li>
</ul>
