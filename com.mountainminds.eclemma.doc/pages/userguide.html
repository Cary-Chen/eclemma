<h1>User Guide</h1>

<p>
  EclEmma records which parts of your Java code are executed during a particular
  program launch. Therefore coverage analysis always involves two steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run the program</li>
  <li>Analyze coverage data</li>
</ol>
  
<p>
  For reproducible results the launched programs are typically automated tests
  like JUnit tests.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="launching.html">Running</a> a coverage analysis is as simple as
  pressing a single button like the existing <i>Run</i> and <i>Debug</i>
  buttons. The coverage results are automatically summarized in the
  <a href="coverageview.html"><i>Coverage</i> view</a> and highlighted in the
  <a href="annotations.html">Java editors</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Warning:</b> Although EclEmma is internally based on EMMA it does not require
  any EMMA specific parameters and classpath settings in your projects. The fact
  that EMMA is used is completely transparent to the user and all required
  settings are dynamically created by the
  <a href="launching.html"><i>Coverage</i> launcher</a>. <b>Adding emma.jar to
  your projects' classpath or setting properties for EMMA may result in errors
  during the coverage launch.</b>
